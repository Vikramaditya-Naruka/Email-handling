**Email-handling**


This Python script provides a comprehensive approach to email handling, including sending and receiving emails, 
parsing email content, and handling attachments.
The script demonstrates the use of `smtplib` for sending emails and `imaplib` for receiving and processing emails. 
It also includes functions to extract key information from emails, such as sender email, subject, and attachment status. Additionally,
it provides functionality to download attachments and store the extracted data in an Excel file. 
The script emphasizes security by suggesting the use of environment variables and app passwords.
